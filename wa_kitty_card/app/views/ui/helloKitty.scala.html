<h2>General Stuff:</h2>
<p>When you start the game, you will be asked to choose a mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single</li>
  <li>Multiplayer</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Single player mode has a special feature but the game can NOT be played
  as single player, as it needs two people. Then you will be asked to load
  or save a game. If its youre first time Playing it, obvious you need to
  start a new game.

<h3><strong>Normal Mode:</strong> ≽^•˕•^≼</h3>

<h4><em>About Rounds:</em></h4>
<p>At the start of each game, both players decide the order to play.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The player going first receives 3
    cards.
  </li>
  <li>
    The player going second receives
    also 3 cards.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Players alternate turns, and each round, they can choose to either
  [Play] a card or
  [Draw] a card. When all 9 cups are filled
  with kitties, the player with
  more points wins the game.
</p>

<h4><em>About Cards:</em></h4>
<p>
  There are 4 colors of cards and
  5 colors of cups, including the
  white cup.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are the ACE and Bomb cards.</li>
  <li>The ace card freezes the enemy! More rounds for you!</li>
  <li>
    If you get the bomb card, consider yourself lucky since it's
    the best! Most points and it destroys the enemy's card AND
    lets you play again. If you don't win that round it's on you.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><em>About Points:</em></h4>
<ul>
  <li>You can put your cards in any unoccupied cups.</li>
  <li>
    Place kitties in the cups and score points based on the cup
    color.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Matched Cup</strong> (kitty color matches cup color)
    gives double points.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>White Cup</strong> gives
    standard points.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Unmatched Cup</strong> (kitty color doesn't match the
    cup color) gives no points.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><em>About the card placement:</em></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Careful where you place your card! If you place it in the
    wrong cell the cat will destroy it! Your turn will be
    canceled.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><em>About the winner:</em></h4>
<ul>
  <li>The one with most Points will win.</li>
  <li>
    If you get the ACE, you are
    lucky! You will be able to freeze your enemy! Although it
    might only give you one point, but a win is a win!
  </li>
  <li>Other modes to be added in the future (ahem Semester 5)</li>
</ul>
